	<h1> Project Proposal </h1>

    <br>
    <h3> What is your website about? </h3>
    <h5>This website is about the best bars on Cape Cod. I have spent my whole life living in Orleans on the cape, and with that has come a great understanding of the best places to grab a drink in the summer. I will be covering the entirety of Cape Cod from Falmouth all the way to Province Town. The criteria that will be used in the bars I will cover will be a combination of location, atmosphere, and how good the drinks are.  </h5>   
    <hr>
    <h3>What is the objective of your website? </h3>
    <h5>The purpose of this website is to inform people on vacation in Cape Cod where they can find the best cocktails. Since I will be covering all major parts of the Cape my site will be able to serve people no matter what town they are vacationing in.  </h5>   
    <hr>
    <h3>Who is your target audience?</h3>
    <h5>My target audience is anyone 21 ages and older who are or will be going to Cape Cod and are interested in having drinks at a great spot. Since the purpose of this website is about great locations to consume alcohol anyone who is under the age of 21 is not in my target audience. </h5>
    <hr>
    <h3>What content do you plan to include in each page of your website?</h3>
    <h5>The content I plan on including will consist of the name of the location, where it is, and information similar to that. The content on my site will be organized by different tabs linking to different regions of Cape Cod. Photos of the locations and surroundings will also be including for each spot.</h5>
